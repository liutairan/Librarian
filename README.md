# Librarian
This is going to be a very large software with a lot of functions which are very useful.
You may know that there are a lot of commercial or open source reference management softwares. But sometimes we desire to use a special function which may not be provided by a special software. Changing to another one or using several software messes data up.

Still working on it.

## Main Functions
    Reference management
    Get information from Journals/Conferences/Books/Transactions/etc
    Download papers
    Grouping/sorting
    Creating reference network
    Etc.

## Preview  
Note: All reference data used in the figures are generated by random number, not real reference data or bug.
