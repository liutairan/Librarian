This is going to be a very large software with a lot of functions which are very useful.
You may know that there are a lot of commercial or open source reference management softwares. But sometimes we desire to use a special function which may not provided by a special software. Changing to another one or using several software messes data up.

Still working on it.

## Main Functions
    Reference management 
    Get information from Journals/Conferences/Books/Transactions/etc
    Download papers
    Grouping/sorting
    Creating reference network
    Etc.
